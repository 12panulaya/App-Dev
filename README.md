# My Favorite Movie: "Lilo & Stitch"

## Why I Love It:
- A heartwarming story about ohana (family), which means no one gets left behind.
- Combines humor, adventure, and emotional moments beautifully.
- Features an adorable alien (*Experiment 626*) and his journey of finding a family.

## Favorite Characters:
1. Stitch (Experiment 626): Mischievous, funny, and surprisingly lovable.
2. Lilo Pelekai: A quirky and caring girl who teaches Stitch the true meaning of family.
3. Nani Pelekai: Lilo's sister, who balances responsibility and love in tough times.

> Favorite Quote:

## Fun Fact:
- Lilo & Stitch was one of the first Disney movies to use watercolor backgrounds, giving it a unique and timeless look.
